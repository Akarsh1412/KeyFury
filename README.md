## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

KeyFury is built on a robust, event-driven architecture designed for low-latency, real-time interactions.

- **Real-time Engine with Socket.IO**: The core of the multiplayer experience is powered by Socket.IO. The server listens for events like `createRoom`, `joinRoom`, `startTest`, and `chatMessage`, and efficiently broadcasts state updates to the relevant clients.

- **State Management with Upstash Redis**: The project leverages **Upstash** for a serverless Redis database, ensuring low-latency data access and simplifying management. It serves as the single source of truth for all ephemeral game data:
  - **Room & Player Data**: Stored in Redis Hashes for quick read/write access. This includes live stats and the final `performanceHistory` for each player.
  - **Chat History**: Stored in Redis Lists, capped to the last 50 messages to save memory.
  - **Session Management**: Each socket connection is mapped to a user and room, with a TTL for automatic cleanup.
  - **Efficiency**: **Redis Pipelining** is used to batch multiple commands into a single request, reducing network round-trip time and ensuring atomicity for complex operations.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - **Throttling**: To prevent overwhelming the server with frequent updates, player stats (`WPM`, `progress`) are sent from the client using a custom `useThrottle` hook. This limits the rate of `updateStats` emits to one every 300ms.
  - **Background Services**: The server runs periodic cleanup tasks to validate active rooms and remove stale data, ensuring the application remains stable and performant over time.

- **Hybrid Data Flow**: The application uses a hybrid data flow model. Real-time game events and live stats are handled via WebSockets. After the test, the comprehensive results, including `performanceHistory`, are fetched via a standard RESTful API endpoint (`/api/results/:roomId`). This approach leverages the strengths of both protocols: WebSockets for low-latency live updates and REST for retrieving a final, complete dataset.

- **Game Synchronization**: The `useSyncedTimer` custom hook on the frontend works in tandem with the server to keep all players' timers perfectly aligned. The server broadcasts sync events every 2 seconds, and the client-side hook intelligently corrects for network latency, providing a smooth and fair countdown experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Redis instance. The project is configured for **[Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/)**, but a local instance or another cloud provider will also work.

### 1. Clone the Repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Akarsh1412/KeyFury
  cd KeyFury
  ```

### 2. Backend Setup
- Navigate to the server directory
  ```
  cd server
  ```
- Install dependencies
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Create a `.env` file. You can get your `REDIS_URL` and `REDIS_TOKEN` from your Upstash database console.

  **`server/.env`**
  ```
  PORT=5000
  CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

  REDIS_URL=YOUR_UPSTASH_REDIS_URL
  REDIS_TOKEN=YOUR_UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN
  ```

- Finally, start the backend server:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
### 3. Frontend Setup
- Navigate to the client directory from the root
  ```
  cd client
  ```
- Install dependencies
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Set up a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Enable Email/Password and Google authentication methods. Then, get your project's configuration keys and add them to a new `.env` file.

    **`client/.env`**
  ```
  VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:5000"

  VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
  VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
  VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
  VITE_FIREBASE_STORGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
  VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
  VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
  VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
  ```
- Finally, start the frontend development server:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```


You can now access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üì° API and Key Events

- `createRoom`: Initializes a new room with the creator as the leader.
- `joinRoom`: Allows a user to join an existing room.
- `leaveRoom`: Removes a player from a room and handles leader reassignment if necessary.
- `chatMessage`: Broadcasts a message to all players in a room.
- `startTest`: Initiated by the room leader; starts the countdown for all players.
- `updateStats`: Sent from a client to the server to update their live game statistics.
- `liveStats`: Broadcast from the server to all clients with updated stats for all players.
